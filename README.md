# Audio-Classification
#Developed a deep learning model for classifying audio signals into various categories. Utilized ANNs amd audio feature extraction techniques MFCC (Mel-Frequency-Cepstral-Coefficient) to process and analyze audio data. Achieved high classification accuracy and optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Librosa.
